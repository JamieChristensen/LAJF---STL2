    - A perfect being, astonishing and great.                            It even
      came with the following trait!
    - The next part will describe the creature,                                           
      as gods gave it this very feature!
    - Despite their ability, no hero should be spared.                                                                 
      Forged in divinity, this enemy came prepared!
    - One by one they all got tougher.                                     The task
      was simply, to make the hero suffer!
