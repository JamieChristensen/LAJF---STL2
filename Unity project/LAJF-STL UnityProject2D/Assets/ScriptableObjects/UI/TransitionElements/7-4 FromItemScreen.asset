      to a monster of terror and demise! '
    - Finally relief as the road came to a stop.                                       
      But the gods were just starting to warm up!
    - Safe and sound the hero cheered obliviously.                                        
      Little did they know,                                                     
      it was time to take it seriously!
    - Both daring and bold the hero would saddle,                                     
      with just, behold, a final battle!
